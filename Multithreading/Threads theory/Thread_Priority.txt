In Java, each thread has a priority that helps the CPU decide which thread to run first when multiple threads are waiting.

ðŸ”¥ Default Thread Priorities
Every thread has a default priority of 5 (i.e., NORM_PRIORITY).
We can change a threadâ€™s priority using .setPriority(int), where:
1 (MIN_PRIORITY) â†’ Lowest priority
5 (NORM_PRIORITY) â†’ Default priority
10 (MAX_PRIORITY) â†’ Highest priority
